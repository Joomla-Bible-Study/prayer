Prayer is the privilege of touching the heart of the Father through His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord.\n\n Draw near to God and He will draw near to you. James 4:8\n\nBe anxious for nothing, but in everything by prayer and supplication with thanksgiving let your requests be made known to God. And the peace of God, which surpasses all comprehension, shall guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus. Phil. 4:6-7\n\nFather, in Your mercy, hear our prayers."
